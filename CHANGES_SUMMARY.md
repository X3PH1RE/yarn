# Changes Summary - Multi-User Meeting Implementation

## What Was Changed

### 1. Meeting Component (`src/pages/Meeting.tsx`)
**Complete rewrite** to support real-time multi-user meetings:

- ✅ **Real Socket.IO integration** - Connects to Node.js server for real-time features
- ✅ **Name entry dialog** - Users enter their name before joining
- ✅ **Room code display** - Shows 6-character room code with copy button
- ✅ **Live participant grid** - Shows all connected users in real-time
- ✅ **Audio streaming** - Captures microphone and streams to Deepgram via Socket.IO
- ✅ **Live transcription** - Displays real-time speech-to-text from Deepgram
- ✅ **AI chat with FastAPI** - Queries sent directly to your Python backend using Gemini
- ✅ **Beautiful UI** - Modern, professional interface with proper styling
- ✅ **Toast notifications** - User-friendly notifications for actions

### 2. Hero Section (`src/components/HeroSection.tsx`)
- ✅ Generate uppercase room codes for better readability

### 3. Socket.IO Server (`server/src/index.ts`)
**Simplified and fixed**:

- ✅ Removed AI handling (now done by FastAPI)
- ✅ Fixed Deepgram event listener (`Transcript` instead of `Results`)
- ✅ Focused on core real-time features:
  - Room/participant management
  - Audio streaming to Deepgram
  - Transcription broadcasting

### 4. Documentation
**New files created**:

- ✅ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed system architecture documentation
- ✅ `MEETING_USAGE.md` - User guide for meetings
- ✅ `server/README.md` - Socket.IO server documentation
- ✅ `server/.env.example` - Environment variable template
- ✅ `check-services.js` - Service health checker utility

**Updated files**:

- ✅ `README.md` - Complete rewrite with quick start, architecture diagram, troubleshooting
- ✅ Added `npm run check` script to verify all services are running

## Architecture

### Before
- Mock participants (hardcoded)
- No real Socket.IO connection
- AI queries through Socket.IO (not working)
- Single-user experience

### After
```
Frontend (React)
    ├── WebSocket → Socket.IO Server → Deepgram (Live transcription)
    └── HTTP API → FastAPI Backend → Gemini (AI analysis)
```

**Socket.IO Server handles:**
- Real-time participants
- Audio streaming
- Live transcription broadcasting

**FastAPI Backend handles:**
- AI queries about meeting content
- Transcript analysis with Gemini

## How It Works Now

### Creating a Meeting
1. User clicks "Create a yarn"
2. Random 6-character room code generated (e.g., `ABC123`)
3. User enters their name
4. Frontend connects to Socket.IO server
5. User joins the room
6. Room code displayed with copy button

### Joining a Meeting
1. Another user clicks "Join a yarn"
2. Enters the room code shared by first user
3. Enters their name
4. Frontend connects to same room
5. Both users see each other in participant grid

### During Meeting
1. **Microphone** - User clicks mic button to unmute
2. **Audio Capture** - Browser captures audio at 16kHz
3. **Streaming** - Audio sent to Socket.IO server as PCM data
4. **Transcription** - Server forwards to Deepgram WebSocket
5. **Broadcasting** - Deepgram returns transcript, server broadcasts to all
6. **Display** - All participants see live transcript with speaker labels
7. **AI Chat** - User asks question → sent to FastAPI → Gemini analyzes transcript → answer displayed

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

**Create `server/.env`:**
```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key_here
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
PORT=5174
```

**Update `server/main.py` (line 24):**
```python
# Remove the hardcoded key
GEMINI_API_KEY = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")  # Load from .env instead
```

### 2. Start All Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Socket.IO Server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Python Backend
cd server
python main.py
```

### 3. Test Multi-User Functionality

**Browser 1:**
1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Create a yarn"
3. Enter name (e.g., "Alice")
4. Copy the room code

**Browser 2 (incognito or different browser):**
1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Join a yarn"
3. Enter the room code
4. Enter name (e.g., "Bob")

**Both users should:**
- See each other in the participant grid
- See the same live transcription when speaking
- Be able to ask AI questions (responses sent to their FastAPI backend)

### 4. Verify Services

Run the health check:
```bash
npm run check
```

This will verify all 3 services are running.

5. **User Authentication** - Login system
6. **Meeting Scheduling** - Calendar integration
7. **Export Transcripts** - Download as PDF/TXT
8. **Custom AI Prompts** - Let users customize AI behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working
- Check browser permissions (should be localhost for development)
- Click the microphone button to unmute
- Check console for errors

### No Transcription
- Verify `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` in `server/.env`
- Check Socket.IO server logs
- Ensure Deepgram account has credits

### AI Not Responding
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `server/main.py`
- Check Python backend logs
- Ensure there's transcript content

### Can't See Other Participants
- Verify all 3 services are running (`npm run check`)
- Check browser console for Socket.IO errors
- Ensure both users are in the same room code
